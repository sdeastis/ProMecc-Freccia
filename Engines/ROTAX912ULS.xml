  <bore unit="IN">				 3.31	</bore>					<!-- cylinder bore is currently unused. -->

  <stroke unit="IN">			 2.40	</stroke>				<!-- piston stroke is used to determine the mean piston speed. 
																A longer stroke results in an engine that does not work as well at higher speeds -->

  <compression-ratio>			10.8	</compression-ratio>	<!-- the compression ratio affects the change in volumetric efficiency with altitude.-->

  <maxhp>					   100.0	</maxhp>				<!-- this value is the nominal power the engine creates at maxrpm.
																It will determine bsfc if that tag is not input. It also determines 
																the starter motor power. --> 

  <cycles>						 4.0	</cycles>				<!-- Designate a 2 or 4 stroke engine. 
																Currently only the 4 stroke engine is supported. -->

  <idlerpm>					  1400.0	</idlerpm>				<!-- this value affects the throttle fall off.
																The engine stops running when its RPM's are less than 80% of this value.
																The engine starts running when its RPM's are greater than 80% of this value. -->
																
  <maxrpm>					  5800.0	</maxrpm>				<!-- this value is used to calculate air-box resistance and BSFC.
																It also affects oil pressure among other things. -->

		<!-- AIR INTAKE -->			
  <man-press-lag>				 0.05	</man-press-lag>		<!-- Basically sets how fast the engine will accelerate. It has to be found by tuning, 
																and you'd need a video including a view of the throttle and tachometer / MP gauge 
																to make this realistic unless reported in POH/FlightManual-->

  <ram-air-factor> 				 3.0	</ram-air-factor>		<!-- this value creates additional manifold pressure linked to qbar (aircraft speed). 
																0 turns ram air off, all other values are multiplication of qbar simulating venturi 
																effect of the air scoop -->

 <air-intake-impedance-factor>	 0.115 	</air-intake-impedance-factor> <!-- 0.05 , zero for boosted engines -->
																<!-- this number is the pressure drop across the intake system cause by the inlet air filter -->

		<!-- THROTTLE -->																	

  <maxmp unit="INHG">			35.0	</maxmp>				<!-- this value is the nominal maximum manifold pressure at sea-level 
																without boost. Along with maxrpm it determines the resistance of the 
																aircraft's intake system. See air-intake-impedance-factor  -->

  <minmp unit="INHG">			 7.2	</minmp>				<!-- this value is the nominal idle manifold pressure at sea-level 
																without boost. It is determined by reducing the throttle and 
																recording the Manifold pressure when the engine RPM is at the 
																required idle speed -->
															
		<!-- POWER PRODUCTION -->		
		
  <sparkfaildrop>				 0.1	</sparkfaildrop>		<!-- this is the percentage drop in horsepower for single magneto operation, 
																try a value of 0.8 or so. If you have the drop amount in the POH/FlightManula
																of the aircraft, turn off one magneto and adjust this value at runtime to match it. -->
																
  <volumetric-efficiency>		 0.7504	</volumetric-efficiency><!-- Controls how efficient the intake/outlet system is in allowing 
																mixture to pass through the engine. Adjust this value to give correct 
																fuel consumption at a known rpm and manifold pressure. This value is 
																exposed on the property tree so it may be altered at runtime -->

  <bsfc>           				 0.3245	</bsfc>					<!-- Adjust this to produce the known power at a known rpm and manifold pressure.
																For this engine it is 890 b.h.p. at 3,000 rpm at sea level inHg of 42.65.
																This value is exposed on the property tree so it may be altered at runtime.	 -->
   
		<!-- COOLING -->

  <cylinder-head-mass unit="LBS"> 9.25 </cylinder-head-mass>	<!-- The weight of a single cylinder head.... 5.2% of dry engine
																The larger the value the slower the changes in engine temperature. -->
  
  <cooling-factor> 0.36 </cooling-factor>						<!-- Controls how efficient the aircraft cooling system is.
																Adjust this value to create a 5 min max usage before engine overheating and also simulate the cowl flaps.
																This value is exposed on the property tree so it may be altered at runtime. -->
